# Packy


### Introducing Packy!

It’s increasing popular for businesses to sell bulk packages/credits to customers. While this is more “value for money”, have you ever bought a fitness/beauty/any package, only for it to expire? Avoid having money wasted or having to beg for a package extension with Packy! Packy keeps track of any type of packages you may have purchase - from the number of sessions left to its expiry.

### Code Functionalities

1. Data was stored in NoSQL DB MongoDB 
2. For Backend: I continued using Express 
3. For Frontend: I used React and experiment with TypeScript. 

### Learnings

**Biggest Challenge:** Timeline

**Key Learnings:** 

1. I think as we all can comfortably code out a web app, we have other considerations. E.g what is a better way to store data, or where to place certain code. 
2. Learning new languages, tools, frameworks will be a constant. It can be quite overwhelming but it’s good to take one step at a time. 

### Next Steps:

The initial ideation came from a mobile app idea, but was done in an app format. Moving forward, I hope to move this into an actual mobile app. 

I also hope to expand this to other form of tracking, such as subscriptions etc.
